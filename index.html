           Attack on Titan, AOT for short, is a Japanese anime series set in a
           world where humanity is endangered by enormous humanistic creatures
           known as Titans. The story primarily follows three characters: Eren
           Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armen Arlet. They join the military to
           fight against the Titans after their hometown is destroyed by them.

         <h3>Why Attack on Titan is my favorite show</h3>
         <!-- used figure and figcaption for later use in CSS to style figcaption -->
         <figure>
           <img
             id="bird-image"
             src="./img/birds_in_flight.jpg"
             alt="many birds in flight"
           />
         </figure>
         <figcaption>
           Throughout the show, birds are depicted as symbols of freedom since
           the Titans can't get to them.

         <ul>
           <li>For an anime show, it is incredibly deep and thought out.</li>
           <li>I really like the animation style.</li>
           <li>
             It shows a war in which you can understand the point of view from
             both sides. You can even understand Eren's point of view when he
             goes from hero to villain, even if you may not agree with him, and I think that's incredibly important.
           </li>
           <li>There are so many layers to the story.</li>
